XFuscator - The Best Lua Obfuscator 3V4R
----------------------------------------

Disclaimer:
Might not actually be the best one ever. 
If you find a better one, tell me so I can make XFuscator better than it.

NOTE: Files become much larger. A 1KB file can easily go to 5-15 KB.
XFuscator (about 10 KB) becomes 500-700 KB. 


Features:
- Remove comments
- Rename ALL local variables SAFELY (see below, obfuscates precompiled local names also)
- extract all constants
- Remove extra whitespace
- Add fluff
- precompile with loadstring
- precompiled chunks have their locals made completely unrepresentable
- encode source (or binary chunk)
- Add unrepresentable characters in comments
- In precompiled code, renames locals to something like <local$1>_[0-20 chars of range 0-255]
- option to encrypt constant strings (uses XOR with random key)
- Tamper detection (length checking)
TODO:
- Tamper detection (SHA256 hash)
- Add ROBLOX features to make the game crash if the script was stolen
- extract global variables and replace with a CONSTANT_POOL index (no, because this would cause issues when one changed)
- encode (binary, hex)

Usage:
- install lua5.2
lua5.2 XFuscator.lua "%1" -uglify -level 1 -max "%2"
